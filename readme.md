# Quote of the Day

This is my **first project using an API**. 
It displays an inspirational quote each day, fetched from the [ZenQuotes API](https://zenquotes.io/).  
I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learned how to handle API requests, CORS issues, and local storage.

## Features

- Fetches a new quote once per day
- Displays the quote and author in a clean layout
- Stores the quote locally so it doesn't change on page reload
- Uses a proxy to bypass CORS restrictions

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- `fetch()` for API calls
- `localStorage` for daily quote caching
- [AllOrigins](https://allorigins.win) proxy for CORS handling

## What I Learned

- How to work with public APIs in frontend development
- How to handle CORS errors using a proxy
- How to store and retrieve data using `localStorage`
- How to structure JavaScript for readability and reusability
